Chords:
A A7 D Dm C G Am F E
G G7 C Cm Bb F Gm F Em D

A
So without a thought I thought I'd take a final walk
A7
The tide of public opinion had started to abate
D
The neighbors (bless 'em) had turned out to be all talk
Dm
I could see their frightened faces peering at me through the gate

A
Was looking for an end to this for some kind of closure
A7                                             D
Time moved so rapidly I had no hope of keeping track of it

And I thought of my friends who had died of exposure
      Dm
And I remembered all the ones who had died from the lack of it

A
And in my best shoes I started falling forward down the street
A7
Stopped at a church and jostled through the crowd
D
Love followed just behind me panting at my feet as the
Dm
Steeple tore the stomach from a lonely little cloud

A
Inside I sat seeking the presence of a God
A7
Searched through the pictures in a leather-bound book
      D
And I found a wooly lamb dozing in an issue of blood
      Dm
And a gilled Jesus shivering on a fisherman's hook

A
Babe
            A7
It seems so long
                  D    Dm
Since you've been gone away
    C            G
And I just gotta say
              Am     G        F    E
That it grows darker with the day

A                                             A7
Back on the street I saw a great, big smiling sun
                                          D
It was a good day and an evil day and all was bright and new
                                                   Dm
And it seemed to me the most destruction was being done

By those who could not choose between the two
A
Amateurs, dilettantes, hacks, cowboys, clones
A7                                                      D
The streets groaned with little ceasars, napoleons, and cunts

With their building blocks and their tiny plastic phones
Dm
Counting on their fingers with the crumbs down their fronts

A                                  A7
I passed by garden so you with your flowers
                                          D
The camellias, magnolias, and azaleas so sweet

I stood there invisible in the panicking crowds
Dm
You looked so beautiful in the rising heat
A
I smell smoke see little fires bursting on the lawns
A7
People carry on regardless listening to their hands
D
Great cracks appear in the pavement, the earth yawns
Dm
Bored in disgusted to do us down

A
Babe
            A7
It seems so long
      D                Dm
Since you've been gone away
    C            G
And I just gotta say
              Am     G        F    E
That it grows darker with the day

A
All these streets are frozen now; I come and go
A7
Full of a longing for something I do not know
D
My father sits slumped in the deepening snow
Dm
As I search in and out, above, about, and below

A
Babe
            A7
It seems so long
      D                Dm
Since you've been gone away
    C            G
And I hope and I pray
              Am     G        F    E
That it grows darker with the day
